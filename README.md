# leonardishere.github.io

This might just be the worst (least descriptive) README I've ever seen. But at least it isn't incredibly verbose.

index.html: landing page.
script.js: js for landing page. should be renamed index.js probably
index.css: doesnt exist yet, but it should be created. maybe not. we'll see

everything else: preloaded crap that I havent touched yet
