		<p>Welcome to the most official of all Andrew Leonard sites. Andrew Leonard, also (not really) known online as Leonardishere, has just launched his second venture as founder/cofounder: <b>Leonard Studios!</b> No promises, but this should be fun. Stick around and see what happens.</p>
		<p>This site is currently under construction. Come back later and maybe there will be something here.</p>
		<p>For now, find me on Linkedin! <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewjohnleonard">https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewjohnleonard</a></p>
		<p>This page should redirect to my aesthetic page hosted by wix. If it doesn't, then click <a href="https://leonardishere.wixsite.com/professional">here</a>.</p>
